                                            <p>WooCommerce store owners can sync their account inventory with Giddh in a click. If a group or stock is not available in Giddh as per the WooCommerce requirements, then the Giddh software creates it while syncing. Thus, the WooCommerce store owners don’t have to bother about any intricacy of the process. The complete syncing process is hassle-free. Further, the store owners can update their stock quantity in WooCommerce by syncing it with Giddh. They can also create stock in their WooCommerce account from Giddh.</p>
